## Structured
**Key characteristics:**
* Fixed page format
* Identifies where and what to enter
* Areas for data entry are clearly defined and labeled (e.g. textbox, checkbox, etc.)
* Fields have one-to-one mapping with values (e.g. Account Number)

**Examples:**
* Tax forms
* Identification cards
* Application forms

## Semi-structured
**Key characteristics:**
* No fixed page format
* Information is usually grouped in a logical manner

**Examples:**
* Invoices
* Receipts
* Purchase orders

## Unstructured

* Little to no organization
* Continous, verbose, text-heavy content
* Information is can be communicated in sentence or paragraph
* Complex for non-subject matter experts to read and understand

**Examples:**
