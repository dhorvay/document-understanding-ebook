OCRFeeder is a document layout analysis and optical character recognition system. Given the images it will automatically outline its contents, distinguish between what's graphics and text and perform OCR over the latter. It generates multiple formats being its main one ODT. OCRFeeder has a GTK+ graphical user interface that allows the users to control the application and, for example, edit and correct the automatic recognition. It can also be used from the command line for automation.
